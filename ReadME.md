# Card Game

- Build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game!
- It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!
- This card game has been developed using JavaScript, JQuery, HTML and CSS

## How the Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## How to Run

1. Extract the zipped contents. 
2. Open the index.html file inside 'cardGame' directory to start playing the game in your browser.

## What did I Learn?
- The memory game presents the first opportunity to fully combine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying these skills with these three technologies, I discovered how best to combine them in a complex application.

### The following are just some of the questions that l experienced along the way:

- What's the ideal workflow?
- How many files do I need?
- Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
- How many JavaScript functions do I need?
- Should my function be this many lines of code?
- While building this project, working with mentors, and getting feedback from the project reviewer I developed my answers to these questions.
